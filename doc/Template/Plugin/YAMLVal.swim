yamlval vmethod for Template Toolkit

<badge travis coveralls ingydotnet/template-plugin-yamlval-pm>

= Synopsis

  [% USE YAMLVal %]
  foo: [% foo.yamlval %]
  bar: [% bar.yamlval %]

= Description

This module lets you use Template Toolkit to write out YAML mapping files in a
certain top level key order, while making sure that the keys are properly YAML
encoded.

There may be other use cases, but that's the one that drove me to write this.
