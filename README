NAME
    Template::Plugin::YAMLVal - yamlval vmethod for Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
        [% USE YAMLVal %]
        foo: [% foo.yamlval %]
        bar: [% bar.yamlval %]

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you use Template Toolkit to write out YAML mapping
    files in a certain top level key order, while making sure that the keys
    are properly YAML encoded.

    There may be other use cases, but that's the one that drove me to write
    this.

SEE ALSO
    *   Template

    *   YAML
